## Database Design

The project database is designed to support core functionality such as user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. Below are the key entities, their important fields, and their relationships.

### 1. Users
- **Fields:**  
  - `user_id` (Primary Key)  
  - `name`  
  - `email` (unique)  
  - `password_hash`  
  - `role` (e.g., admin, host, customer)  
- **Notes:** Users can act as customers (booking properties) or hosts (listing properties).

### 2. Properties
- **Fields:**  
  - `property_id` (Primary Key)  
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
  - `title`  
  - `description`  
  - `location`  
- **Notes:** A property is created by a user (host). One user can have many properties.

### 3. Bookings
- **Fields:**  
  - `booking_id` (Primary Key)  
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
  - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)  
  - `check_in_date`  
  - `check_out_date`  
- **Notes:** A booking links a user (customer) to a property. One property can have multiple bookings.

### 4. Payments
- **Fields:**  
  - `payment_id` (Primary Key)  
  - `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings)  
  - `amount`  
  - `payment_date`  
  - `status` (e.g., pending, completed, failed)  
- **Notes:** Each booking has one corresponding payment record.

### 5. Reviews
- **Fields:**  
  - `review_id` (Primary Key)  
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)  
  - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)  
  - `rating` (1–5)  
  - `comment`  
- **Notes:** A user can leave multiple reviews, but only one per property per booking. Properties can have many reviews.


### Entity Relationships
- A **User** can list many **Properties**.  
- A **User** can make many **Bookings**.  
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.  
- A **Booking** has one **Payment**.  
- A **Property** can have many **Reviews**, each written by a **User**.  

## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project provides a variety of features to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb and ensure a smooth user experience:

### 1. User Management
- Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely.  
- Includes role-based access (e.g., customer, host, admin) to ensure proper permissions for different types of users.  

### 2. Property Management
- Hosts can list, update, and remove properties with details such as title, description, location, and price.  
- Enables users to browse available properties and filter them by location, price, or amenities.  

### 3. Booking System
- Customers can book properties for specific dates with real-time availability checks.  
- Manages booking confirmations, cancellations, and modifications.  

### 4. Payment Integration
- Provides secure online payment for bookings.  
- Ensures smooth transaction handling with support for payment status tracking (pending, completed, failed).  

### 5. Review & Rating System
- Allows users to leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve booked.  
- Helps build trust between hosts and customers by showcasing honest feedback.  

### 6. Search & Filtering
- Users can search properties by location, price range, and availability.  
- Advanced filtering ensures customers can quickly find the most suitable property.  


## API Security

Security is critical in ensuring trust and protecting sensitive information in the Airbnb Clone project. Key measures include:

### 1. Authentication
- Uses secure login (e.g., JWT or OAuth2) to verify user identities.  
- Prevents unauthorized access to the system.  

### 2. Authorization
- Role-based access ensures that only authorized users can perform certain actions (e.g., only hosts can list properties).  
- Protects resources and prevents data misuse.  

### 3. Data Encryption
- Sensitive information (passwords, payment details) is encrypted both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.  
- Prevents data breaches and protects user privacy.  

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Limits the number of require

  ## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines are automated workflows that help teams build, test, and deploy applications efficiently.  

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Ensures that every code change pushed to the repository is automatically built and tested, reducing bugs and integration issues.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploys tested code to staging or production environments, enabling faster and more reliable releases.  

### Why It’s Important
- Improves code quality by running automated tests before merging changes.  
- Speeds up development by reducing manual steps.  
- Ensures consistent deployments across different environments.  
- Helps detect and fix issues early in the development process.  

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, building, and deployment tasks directly from the repository.  
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent application enviro
